# Pipeline Network Management System

## Overview
The Pipeline Network Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to facilitate the management, analysis, and optimization of pipeline networks. This system provides a range of features including network visualization, maximum flow analysis using various algorithms, identification of pipes needing replacement, calculation of blockage probabilities, and implementation of the MFIP algorithm for flow optimization.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the critical importance of efficient management of pipeline infrastructure. Pipelines are vital for transporting fluids or gases in various industries such as oil and gas, water supply, and sewage systems. Effective management of these networks is essential to ensure operational efficiency, safety, and reliability. By developing this system, we aim to provide pipeline operators and managers with a powerful toolset to better understand, analyze, and optimize their pipeline networks.

## Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly system for inputting, visualizing, and analyzing pipeline networks.
- Implement algorithms for maximum flow analysis (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Dinic) to optimize flow rates within the network.
- Identify pipes in need of replacement based on predefined criteria such as age and degradation.
- Calculate the probability of blockage for each pipe to assess potential maintenance needs.
- Implement the MFIP (Maximum Flow Incremental Paths) algorithm to optimize flow distribution within the network.
